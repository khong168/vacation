    <h2>Things to do here</h2>
    <p><em>Be brave.</em> Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness
    unless you've known sorrow.</p>

      <p>This is the fun part And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

    <p><span class="great">In this world, everything can be happy.</span> Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. We have a fantastic little sky! We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We'll play with clouds today.</p>
